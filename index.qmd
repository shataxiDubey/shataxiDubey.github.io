Hi, I am Shataxi Dubey — an AI/ML Engineer at SmartSense Consulting Solutions, passionate about building intelligent systems that see and understand the world.

My interest lies in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). During my Master’s thesis, I explored how VLMs can be applied to satellite imagery — a challenging and high-impact domain. Before diving into VLMs, I focused on using models like Faster R-CNN and YOLO to detect brick kilns in satellite images, aiming to address their role as a major source of air pollution.

These days, I am deepening my understanding of how VLMs are designed and how they can be leveraged for versatile tasks, including object detection and beyond.
